# Not Suitable for Life Blog

Not Suitable for Life is a personal blog where I can share my thoughts and experiences around navigating a world where everything just is not designed for people like you. By which I mean, people with anxiety, introverts, highly sensitive people, people any form of neurodivergence... When the world expects everyone to be everything you are not, it's a constant struggle just to make it through each day without having all your energy drained out of you.

This blog hopes to both allow me the space and freedom to write about these things, because writing is often the best way for me to process and deal with my feelings - as well as hopefully offering a sense of companionship and compassion to anyone else who, like me, finds the world to be a too loud, too much, too difficult place. Perhaps even helping other lost souls to figure out why they have always felt out of step with the world. But also, hopefully, shining light on the perspective that it's not us that is wrong, it's just that the world isn't set up to accommodate people like us. And maybe that's something that needs to change.

## Features

### Recent

The homepage of the blog is the Recent page, which will display the most recently posted entries, newest first.

### All Posts

The second page will contain all the entries posted to the blog, displayed in a compact way to make navigating easier (probably title, date and brief description).

There will ideally be a way to either filter entries or sort by categories/tags in order to find posts on particular topics, or show entries in a given time frame etc.

### Stats

Then of course I will have to have a stats page, because I'm a nerd and obsessed with stats ;P That could include number of entries, word counts, list of categories/tags with number of entries posted in each - both overall and in a given time frame.

### About

Finally, an about page which will just be a brief overview of me and the blog.

Maybe that could include contact information too. But I may need to set up a new email for that, unless I just use one of my normal ones.

### Features to Add

It would be nice eventually to have a way for visitors to create an account to and to be able to respond to blog posts with some form of like feature and comments.

A calendar feature would be nice as well, to get an overview of how many entries were posted in each month/year etc.

Probably a contact form too so people can easily send messages/questions/articles they'd like to see etc.

Also eventually it would be good to have a 'sign up for updates' feature where people could then get emails when I post.
